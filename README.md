This project is  meant to analyze the Healthcare dataset.
We want to know the number of the patients that were diagnosed in that year and the lenght of stay in the hospital before they were discharged.
We would also like to know the Total Billing Amount, Total Treatment Cost, Total Room Charges, Insurance cost and Out-Of-Pocket amount.
Also we want to find out the number of patients that were admitted in various departments, cities,states and the procdures that were used during treatments.
The Power BI Healthcare Dashboard shows all the requirements of the Healthcare analysis and also shows all the insights that one would like to know.
